Question 1: Consider the following code fragment. Do you think the following code segment will 
result in a syntax error?  If not, what would be the output of the program? 
int x = 12;  
{  
       int x = 4;  
       cout << "1st " << x << endl;  
}  
cout << "2nd " << x << endl;  

the console would print "first 4" and then "2nd 12" because while x at the beginning equals 12, when it is inside the block it is 4. 
And inside that block, is the first print command. Then the console would print 12. 

Question 2: Both a for loop and a while loop execute until the controlling expression becomes 
false. Suppose you have a while loop that executes many times, but you want to exit the loop if a 
certain condition occurs. How do you get out of a loop before the maximum number of loops is 
reached?  

if you wanted to break out of a loop before the max condition is met than you would use a 
"break;" statement.
