how to write lab reports:

Introduction: 
what the lab is all about - summary. 
Learning objectives. 
new concepts and vocabulary that were introduced in the lab. 
(minimum of a good size paragraph) 
1 paragraph should be enough.

Software Methodology:
exercise header 
how you solved the problem. 
pseduo code can work too. 
a picture of the code. 
an explanation of what and why you wrote your code that way. 

How did you solve the problem

"I have an if-else statement and I changed it to a switch statement" 
also a paragraph 
figure labels on images. 

Results: 
what the running program did. 
what were the case tests? 
a paragraph about what the program did and what the output was. 
possibly be 1 or 2 sentences about each test case. 
figure labels for each case that you did. 

Conclusion: 
what you learned from it. 
future work (the concepts I learned today, how can I use them in the future?)
more emphasis here than on Intro. 
2 distinct Paragrapghs. 
1st paragrapgh - what you learned
2nd how it could/will apply in the future.  
Format:
